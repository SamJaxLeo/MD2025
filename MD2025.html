        Happy Mother's Day! I thought that since I couldn't give you a physical gift this year, I would make you a virtual one instead.

        I miss you greatly in college. Usually, I am able to see you every day, but now, I can only come every few months. I miss you a lot and am always thinking about how you are doing, which is why I call so often. You do so many things for me, such as cooking and helping me make decisions, and it is hard to do all this fully on my own.

        One of the things I am always most excited for is being able to see you and everyone else when I come back. I mention it frequently just for fun, but I genuinly look forward to it. I can never focus during class on the days leading up to the flight, continuously thinking about seeing all of you again. I'm very excited for this school year to end and for summer to come, as I'll have the next few months to spend with you.
