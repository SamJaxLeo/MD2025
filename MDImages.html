        Going to Ireland was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. I've always liked nature, and Ireland had so much to see. I enjoyed all of the places we went to and the things we did, such as living in the cottage on the mountain, going on the cruise, and visiting the old castle. The beaches were also fun to go to, as well as the petting zoo. I definitely want to go back sometime soon, this time spending a lot more time there and seeing places we haven't been to before and doing things we didn't have time for.

        Getting a dog was one of the best decisions you made. I knew from the very start that having a dog would be a great experience, and after many years of asking, we got Sam. I remember the day we brought him home and put him inside the playpen, and the hours we would spend sitting inside with him there. We have taken him on so many walks in various different places, and I have had a lot of fun every time. I cannot imagine how we even managed without him for so long. Even though I am in college now, unable to see him all the time, I'm happy that you are still able to spend time with him every day.

        One of the first things I did after coming to Pleasanton was join the choir class, and audition for a solo performance in the upcoming winter concert. The role was given to me, and although I was nervous, I worked hard to practice, and gave my best performance on the day of the concert. At the start of the event, I was looking for you, and throughout the concert, I kept watching to see if you were still paying attention. I remember that you helped me prepare for the concert, when we went to the store to buy the Christmas sweater I would have to wear during the performance. If only we didn't have to go into lockdown, I could have continued on with choir and participated in more concerts, which you could have attended, maybe even with Sam.
